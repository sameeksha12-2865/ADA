This repository contains our work for the project “Cross-Meme Transfer for Meme Stock Forecasting.” We investigate whether viral meme activity on general subreddits influences discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB) and whether this delayed chain offers any predictive signal for meme-stock movements. To improve scientific value, we updated the original problem statement by introducing a temporal, time-lagged causal dimension, shifting from simple same-day correlations to testing whether meme trends propagate over time and affect WSB before impacting stock prices. This allows us to study causal patterns rather than surface-level correlations.

Our experiments involved data collection from meme subreddits and WSB, feature engineering for meme virality, temporal alignment across multiple horizons, and predictive modeling for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day forecasts. We used proper statistical validation, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and full backtesting, to ensure every claim was scientifically defensible.

A key outcome is that negative results are still meaningful. Our models showed that WSB sentiment alone provides almost no predictive power, often performing no better than random guessing.
