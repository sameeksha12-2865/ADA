This repository contains our work for the project “Cross-Meme Transfer for Meme Stock Forecasting”, where we investigate whether viral meme activity on general subreddits can influence WallStreetBets (WSB) discussions and ultimately help predict meme-stock movements. The project originally focused on transferring general meme-virality patterns into financial contexts. To improve novelty and scientific value, we updated the problem statement to introduce a temporal, time-lagged causal dimension. Instead of only correlating same-day meme activity with stock prices, we now analyze how memes trending on general subreddits influence WSB discussions after a delay, and whether this sequential chain produces any measurable stock-movement signal. This temporal extension allows us to test causal propagation rather than simple correlation, making the research more rigorous and theoretically grounded.

Our experiments include data collection from general meme subreddits and WSB, feature engineering for meme virality, temporal alignment across multiple horizons, and predictive modeling for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day stock-movement forecasting. We used proper statistical validation including cross-validation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and full backtesting with compounding returns. This ensured that performance claims—positive or negative—were scientifically defensible. Throughout the project, we also evaluated the usefulness of each feature, discovering that several WSB-related variables contributed little to no predictive power.

A major scientific outcome of this project is that negative results are still valid results. Our earlier phases showed that the core hypothesis—“WSB sentiment can predict stock prices”—does not hold under rigorous testing. The model failed to outperform random guessing, produced non-significant p-values (p = 0.21), and exhibited classic failure patterns such as always predicting upward movements and failing to detect downturns. In fact, the experiment demonstrated that WSB sentiment alone has essentially zero predictive power, confirming that several of our original features were irrelevant. This prevented incorrect conclusions and, more importantly, mirrors real scientific workflow where disproving assumptions advances understanding.

In Phase 5, after fixing pipeline issues and retraining models with cleaner data, we observed slight improvements but still within statistically unreliable ranges due to very small test sample sizes. The best model, Logistic Regression at a 3-day horizon, achieved 54.72% accuracy, a 50% win rate, and beating buy-and-hold in backtesting; however, with only 53 test samples, the results remain within what random chance could reasonably produce. Furthermore, baseline metrics reflected randomness (AUC = 0.5), and the causal model improved only marginally (AUC = 0.54). These findings highlight that although small improvements exist, they are not statistically trustworthy, and hundreds of samples would be required to draw any real conclusions.

Overall, this repository represents both the positive developments in our updated temporal-causal design and the scientific value of demonstrating that certain signals—such as WSB sentiment—cannot reliably predict stock prices. The project serves as a careful, transparent exploration of meme-driven market hypotheses, showing what works, what doesn’t, and why. We also view this as a foundation for Phase 2, where we will implement the temporal causal pipeline more thoroughly and draft the corresponding research paper reflecting both our initial results and the updated framework.
